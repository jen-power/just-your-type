<p>I chose a quote from the movie American Psycho. White, dark grey, and red were chosen as they match the asthetic of the film. I used the serif font Playfair Display for the bulk of the text as it has a clean, readable look. I used the font Unica One for select words to add contrast. At the smallest screen size, the first sentence of the quote is hidden so that the whole quote fits nicely on a mobile screen. As the screen size gets larger I wanted the quote to stay centered in the page with ample white space around the quote. At the large screen size, since there is a lot of white space, I added decorative quotation marks in the two adjacent units to the unit holding the quote. The final sentence is also repeated much larger and set behind the main text to add a more interesting design for large screens. I didn't intend to have "I simply am not there" twice on larger screens (once at the bottom of the text in grey, the other large and red in the background) but given that I could not change the text size using the Typographer at a different screen size, and I was not allowed by Markbot to add a media query changing the text size, I had to improvise by duplicating that text. I would have had an easier time coding this if I did not have to use the Gridifier/Typographier/Modulifier as moving the units around to center the text was a more complicated task than expected.</p>
